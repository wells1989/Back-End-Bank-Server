# Practice-Project-Acme-Bank
Practice Project on web security (express-validator / prepared statements / path traversal protection / csrf middleware)

This was an off-platform practice project, focusing on protecting against a variety of common web attacks

Techniques / Methods used:
- helmet package / express-validator to validate input to protect against XXS attacks
- SQL prepared statements to protect against SQL injections
- CSRF package / middleware / tokens to protect against CSRF attacks
- Path traversal protection to protect against path traversal attacks

NOTE: As this was a complex practice project with most of the code already provided, the uploads only show the file where the above methods were implemented
